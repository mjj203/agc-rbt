# Releasable Basemap Tiles (RBT)

## What is RBT?
RBT (Releasable Basemap Tiles) is a web application that provides map tiles for military and coalition partners. Think of it like Google Maps, but designed for military use with maps that can be safely shared internationally.

### Why RBT is Better Than Older Map Systems
RBT uses **Vector Tiles** instead of the older **Raster Tiles** (like CADRG - Compressed ARC Digitized Raster Graphics) that the military has traditionally used. Here's why this matters:

**Think of it like this:**
- **Raster tiles (old way)** are like digital photographs of maps - they're made of pixels and have a fixed size and quality
- **Vector tiles (RBT's way)** are like digital drawings made of mathematical shapes and text that can be resized perfectly

**Key Advantages of Vector Tiles:**

üéØ **Better Quality at Any Zoom Level**
- Raster: Text becomes blurry when you zoom in (like enlarging a photo)
- Vector: Text and lines stay crisp at any zoom level

üì¶ **Smaller File Sizes**
- Raster: Large image files that take up lots of storage and bandwidth
- Vector: Compact mathematical descriptions that are 60-80% smaller

üåê **Works Better Offline**
- Raster: Need to download many large image files for different zoom levels
- Vector: Download once, works smoothly at all zoom levels

‚ö° **Faster Loading**
- Raster: Must load new images when zooming or panning
- Vector: Smooth transitions because data is already there

üé® **Customizable Appearance**
- Raster: Fixed colors and styles (what you see is what you get)
- Vector: Can change colors, hide/show layers, adjust for day/night use

üîÑ **Better for Coalition Sharing**
- Smaller files mean faster transfer over military networks
- Single vector dataset works for multiple use cases (instead of separate raster sets)
- Partners can customize the display for their specific needs

This makes RBT particularly valuable for military operations where bandwidth is limited, storage space is precious, and maps need to work reliably in various conditions.

## What You'll Need
This application runs using Docker, which is like a virtual container that packages everything needed to run the software. Don't worry if you're new to these tools - we'll guide you through each step.

The [AGC](https://www.agc.army.mil/) Releasable Basemap Tiles (RBT) is important because the capability can be easily shared with international coalition partners and doesn't need to go through the current approval process associated with traditional Limited Distribution (LIMDIS) data. The National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) RBT is based on modern technology and provides access to like-in-kind Standard Map Products such as Topographic Map (TM), Joint Operations Graphic (JOG), and Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) in Vector Tiles format. This format enables rapid transfer across a network or accessed offline from a tile cache. By implementing simple changes in how modern maps are produced and accessed, international coalition partners will be able to track plans and activities using the same basemaps as U.S. services without delays associated with release of classified information.

**RBT** is funded by [NGA](https://www.nga.mil/) and development, demonstration and enhancement will continue with the help of the Army Geospatial Enterprise [AGE](https://www.agc.army.mil/Army-Geospatial-Enterprise/About/) community, [LazarusAI](https://www.lazarusai.com), and [Axis Maps](https://www.axismaps.com/).

## How It Works (Simple Version)
RBT uses several components working together:
- **TileserverGL**: Serves the map tiles (the actual map images)
- **MapProxy**: Helps convert between different map formats  
- **Docker**: Packages everything together so it runs the same on any computer
- **Kubernetes/Docker Compose**: Tools that manage and run the application

RBT is deployed as a containerized application using a modified version of [TileserverGL](https://github.com/mjj203/tileserver-gl) that uses [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) instead of [MapboxGL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), and enables **EPSG:3395** projections for both WMTS and TileJSON endpoints. Additionally, [MapProxy](https://mapproxy.org/) is deployed to enable **EPSG:4326** Raster Tiles via OGC WMTS Endpoints by caching the Raster Tiles created dynamically from the TileserverGL deployment.

The RBT stack is optimized for deployment into a Kubernetes environment in the cloud or on-premises using helm charts. Local deployments can use **Docker Compose** after setting up the local environment with the required tools and getting S3 credentials from our team to download our MBTiles data for TileserverGL using the **AWSCLI**.

# Installation

Before cloning this repo, you will need to ensure **Git**, **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**, **AWSCLI**, and **Docker** are installed and enabled on your system.

## Before You Start

### Computer Requirements
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- At least 500GB of available disk space to run TileserverGL standalone, and 1TB if you plan to run MapProxy to support the GeoPackage cache it creates.
    - cultural-3395.mbtiles: 100GB
    - hillshade-3395.mbtiles: 127GB
    - physical-3395.mbtiles: 102GB
- Internet connection for downloading components
- Minimum 16GB of RAM recommended
- Minimum 8cores CPU recommended

### Skills You'll Need
- Basic familiarity with using a terminal/command prompt
- Ability to copy and paste commands
- Don't worry if you're new to this - we'll guide you through each step!

### What If I Get Stuck?
- Each command should be run one at a time
- If you see an error, don't panic - scroll down to our Troubleshooting section
- Commands that start with `sudo` may ask for your password

## Installation Guide

### Phase 1: Get Permission and Credentials
Before starting, you need special access to download the map data:
1. Email [Tom Boggess](Thomas.J.Boggess@usace.army.mil) to request S3 credentials
2. Wait for approval and credentials (this may take a few days)
3. Once you receive credentials, configure AWS CLI by running:
   ```
   aws configure --profile rbt
   ```
   Enter the provided Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and set the region to `us-east-1`

### Phase 2: Install Required Software
You need to install several tools. Don't worry - we'll explain what each one does:

#### What is AWS CLI?
AWS CLI is a tool that lets you download files from Amazon's cloud storage (where our map data is stored).

#### What is Git?
Git is a tool for downloading and managing code projects. Git LFS handles large files.

#### What is Docker?
Docker packages applications so they run consistently on any computer.

### Phase 3: Download the Map Data
After installing the software and cloning the repository, you'll need to download the map data from S3 using your credentials. The exact command will be provided by the RBT team when you receive your credentials.

## Linux Setup

These commands will install all required software and start RBT. You can copy and paste the entire block into your terminal.

## Windows Setup

### Step 1: Enable WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

WSL lets you run Linux commands on Windows. This is needed because our application works best on Linux.

**For Windows 10/11 [Easy Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install):**

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click Start menu ‚Üí "Windows PowerShell (Admin)")
2. Run: `wsl --install`
3. Restart your computer when prompted

**For Older Windows [Manual Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual):**

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click Start menu ‚Üí "Windows PowerShell (Admin)")
2. Run: `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
3. Run: `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`
4. Restart your computer
5. Download the [WSL2 Linux Kernel update](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).
6. Double-click to run - you will be prompted for elevated permissions, select 'yes' to approve this installation.
7. Run: `wsl --set-default-version 2`
8. Run: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04`
9. Once you have installed WSL, you will need to create a user account and password for your newly installed Linux distribution.

See the [Best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password) for setting up a WSL development environment guide to learn more.

### Step 2: Choose Your Docker Setup

**Option A: Docker Engine in WSL (Preferred)**
- More lightweight
- See [Windows install within WSL](#windows-install-within-wsl) section below

**Option B: Docker Desktop & WSL (GUI)**
- Has a graphical interface
- See [Windows install with Docker Desktop](#windows-install-with-docker-desktop) section below

#### Windows install within WSL

Similar to the Linux install for Ubuntu you can install **git**, **git-lfs**, **docker**, and **awscli** using the CLI.

1. Open your WSL Ubuntu distribution by opening the distro from the Windows Start Menu and running the below commands.

```bash
# Download and install AWS CLI
apt install unzip ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y;
sudo update-ca-certificates;
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" && \
    unzip awscliv2.zip && \
    sudo ./aws/install;

# Remove old Docker versions (if any exist)
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc;


# Add Docker's official repository
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings;
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg;
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null;
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg;

# Install Docker, Git, and Git LFS
sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get install -y \
    docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io \
    docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin \
    git-all git-lfs;

# Enable Git LFS support
git lfs install;

# Clone the RBT project and modify the directory permissions
git clone https://github.com/mjj203/agc-rbt.git && \
    cd agc-rbt;
sudo chmod 755 -R nginx mapproxy tileserver;
sudo chown 1001:1001 -R nginx mapproxy tileserver;

# Start the RBT stack within the agc-rbt parent directory
docker compose up -d;

# Check logs
docker compose logs

# Stop the instance
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

#### Windows install with Docker Desktop

If you prefer to use the Docker Desktop GUI instead of Docker Engine, then follow the [Windows install directions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) and download the [installer](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe). Then follow the [Docker WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/wsl/) and [Microsoft WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) instructions to enable Docker in WSL.

1. Start Docker Desktop from the Windows Start menu.
2. Select Settings -> General.
3. Select the **Use WSL 2 based engine** and **Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375** check boxes.
    
![settings general](images/settings_general.png)

4. Now select Settings -> Resources -> WSL Integration.
5. Select the **Enable integration with my default WSL distro** check box, and turn on additional distros if desired.

![wsl integration](images/wsl_integration.png)

6. To confirm that Docker has been installed, open your WSL distribution
7. Run: `docker --version`
8. From the WSL distribution you can now clone the repo and run **docker compose**:

```bash
# Install Git and Git LFS
sudo apt-get install git-all git-lfs;

# Enable Git LFS support
git lfs install;

# Clone the RBT project and modify the directory permissions
git clone https://github.com/mjj203/agc-rbt.git && \
    cd agc-rbt;
sudo chmod 755 -R nginx mapproxy tileserver;
sudo chown 1001:1001 -R nginx mapproxy tileserver;

# Start the RBT stack within the agc-rbt parent directory
docker compose up -d;

# Check logs
docker compose logs

# Stop the instance
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Command not found" Error
This usually means the software isn't installed or isn't in your system's PATH.
- **Solution**: Try reinstalling the software or restart your terminal

### "Permission denied" Error
This means you need administrator privileges.
- **Solution**: Add `sudo` before the command (on Linux/Mac)

### Docker Won't Start
- **Windows**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- **Linux**: Try `sudo systemctl start docker`
- **Mac**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running

### "Cannot connect to AWS" Error
- **Solution**: Make sure you've configured AWS CLI with `aws configure --profile rbt`

## After Installation

### How to Know It's Working
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/`
- You should see the TileserverGL main page
3. Go to `http://localhost:8081/mapproxy/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml`
- You should see the MapProxy Generated WMTS
4. Go to `http://localhost:8081/mapproxy/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GETCAPABILITIES`
- You should see the MapProxy Generated WMS
5. Alternative (direct) access:
- TileserverGL: `http://localhost:8080` (if you need direct access)
- MapProxy: `http://localhost:8081/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml` (backwards compatibility)

## Connecting GIS Clients to RBT

RBT provides multiple ways for GIS clients (like QGIS, ArcGIS, or Global Mapper) to connect and access map data. With the unified nginx routing, all services are now accessible through port 8081.

### Available Service Endpoints

RBT exposes the following endpoints for GIS client connections through a unified nginx proxy on port 8081:

#### 1. **MapProxy Services** - Best for Standard GIS Clients
- **WMS**: `http://localhost:8081/mapproxy/wms`
- **WMTS**: `http://localhost:8081/mapproxy/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml`
- These provide cached raster tiles in standard OGC formats
- Compatible with virtually all GIS software

#### 2. **TileserverGL Services** - For Modern GIS Clients
- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/`
- **WMTS per style**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/styles/{style-id}/wmts.xml`
- **TileJSON**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/styles/{style-id}.json`
- **Vector Tiles**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/data/{data-id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf`
- **Raster Tiles**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/styles/{style-id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`

#### 3. **Direct Access (Optional)**
If you need to bypass nginx for any reason:
- **TileserverGL**: `http://localhost:8080` (port 8080)
- **MapProxy**: `http://localhost:8081/wms` or `http://localhost:8081/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml` (backwards compatibility)

4. Enter the appropriate URL from above

### Advanced TileserverGL Endpoints

Based on the [TileserverGL documentation](https://tileserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints.html), you can also access through the unified nginx proxy:

- **List all styles**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/styles.json`
- **Style details**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/styles/{style-id}/style.json`
- **Available fonts**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/fonts.json`
- **Static images**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/styles/{style-id}/static/{lon},{lat},{zoom}/{width}x{height}.png`
- **Data inspection**: `http://localhost:8081/tileservergl/data/{data-id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.geojson`

### Choosing the Right Endpoint

- **Use MapProxy endpoints** (`/mapproxy/*`) when:
  - You need maximum compatibility with older GIS software
  - You want cached tiles for better performance
  - You're using standard OGC protocols (WMS/WMTS)

- **Use TileserverGL endpoints** (`/tileservergl/*`) when:
  - You want vector tiles for dynamic styling
  - You need the latest style directly from the source
  - You're using modern GIS clients that support vector tiles

**Benefits of Unified Nginx Routing (Port 8081):**
- Single port for all services simplifies firewall rules
- Consistent URL structure for all endpoints
- Nginx provides additional caching and performance optimization
- Easier to implement SSL/TLS for all services
- Simplified proxy configuration for enterprise environments

### Troubleshooting GIS Client Connections

1. **Connection Failed**: Ensure Docker containers are running (`docker ps`)
2. **No Layers Visible**: Check that you've downloaded the map data (Phase 3)
3. **Slow Performance**: Use MapProxy endpoints for cached tiles
4. **Style Issues**: Vector tiles require GIS client support for MapLibre styles

### How to Stop the Application
Run: `docker compose down --remove-orphans`

### How to Start It Again
Run: `docker compose up -d`
